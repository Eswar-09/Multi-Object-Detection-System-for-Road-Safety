# Multi-Object-Detection-System-for-Road-Safety

This project aims to enhance road safety through the development of a comprehensive Vehicle Safety Detection System using OpenCV. The system facilitates real-time identification of safety compliance measures, including helmet use in 2-wheelers, seat belt detection in 4-wheelers, and accurate recognition of number plates.

## New Additions

### 1. Bike Detection Folder
The Bike Detection folder contains the necessary files for identifying two-wheelers within the captured frames or video feed.

### 2. Car Detection Folder
The Car Detection folder includes the required components for identifying four-wheelers and distinguishing them from other vehicles.

### 3. Seat Belt Detection Folder
The Seat Belt Detection folder contains the latest advancements for accurately detecting seat belt usage within the identified four-wheelers.

### 4. Helmet Detection File
The Helmet Detection file, included within the project, enables the system to accurately identify and ensure the use of helmets by riders of two-wheelers.

## Workflow Overview

1. Vehicle Type Identification: The system first determines the type of vehicle, distinguishing between two-wheelers and four-wheelers.
2. Specific Object Detection:
   - If the vehicle is identified as a 2-wheeler, the system automatically proceeds with helmet detection.
   - If the vehicle is identified as a 4-wheeler, the system initiates seat belt detection.

## Usage

Detailed instructions for running the code and utilizing the system can be found within each folder's README file. Make sure to follow the guidelines and requirements stated in the respective folders for the successful execution of the detection system.

## Contributions

Feel free to contribute to the project by creating pull requests. Your contributions can help improve the accuracy and efficiency of the detection system, thereby enhancing road safety measures.
